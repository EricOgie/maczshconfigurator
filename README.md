## Prerequisites
- `Operating System` - Do not attempt to run this script on any OS other than macOS 

- [Bash Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - The script assumes your macOS already has the Bash shell installed. Though most recent macOS comes with Bash, it won't hurt to confirm.

- [Zsh Shell](https://www.zsh.org) - As per [oh-my-zsh prerequisites](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites), **version 4.3.9+** of Zsh is a requirement for [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions). The script will attempt to install a recent version of [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) if not already installed,  **BUT** it is preferable if you already have it installed.

- [cURL](https://curl.se/) - The script depends on curl to install some of the terminal enhancement tools listed in [Tools and Features](#tools-and-features). It is a reasonable assumption that your macOS already has [cURL](https://curl.se/) installed, but it is safe to confirm. You can run `which curl` on your terminal and check for a positive output like ``/usr/bin/curl`` to confirm that cURL is, indeed, installed

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - The script will attempt to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager if not already installed, **BUT** we prefer you manually install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  before running this script as successful installation of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by this script is not guaranteed. You can visit [Homebrew Documentation](https://brew.sh/) for details on how to install Homebrew package manager on your macOS

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Required to be installed

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - Install iTerm2 terminal for a better terminal experience.
